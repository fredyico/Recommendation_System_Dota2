# Dota 2 Hero Recommendation System

A Python-based recommendation system for Dota 2 heroes. This tool allows users to explore heroes based on attributes, roles, complexity, and tags. It also includes a feature to display all heroes starting with a specific letter.

## Features

- Search heroes based on:
  - Attributes: Universal, Strength, Agility, Intelligence
  - Roles: Carry, Support, Flex
  - Complexity: Low, Moderate, High
  - Tags: Melee, Ranged, Durable, Disabler, Nuker, etc.
- Display all heroes starting with a specific letter.
- User-friendly menu with input validation to guide users effectively.

## How it Works

1. Menu Options:
   - Option 1: Search heroes based on criteria.
   - Option 2: Display all heroes whose names start with a specific letter.
   - Option 3: Exit the program.
2. Hero Filtering:
   - Input criteria for attributes, complexity, roles, and tags.
   - Get a list of heroes matching the selected criteria.
3. Hero Search by Letter:
   - Enter a letter to display all heroes starting with that letter.

## Getting Started

### Note:
Heroes without explicitly defined roles on the Dota 2 website are categorized as 'flex'.

## Development Progress
* Hero database creation
